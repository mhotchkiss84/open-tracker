# open-tracker
This is my Server side capstone for my Full Stack .NET cohort. 

# Overview
This application is being made to allow users to be able to have an all in one project management solution instead of relying on multiple third party solutions, or having to pay for a solution. This application is intended to replace the current solutions by providing an open source platform that can be customized based on the users needs. This application solves the need to have to use multiple applications by combining their functionality into a single application.

Currently this application is being developed with C#, .Net, Identity framework, and Entity framework. I have plans later down the line to switch over to React for the front end and use Django for the backend. I originally wanted to start the project this way but my school has limited me to using the current tech stack. The reason why I will be switching to React is for a better user exerpeince. One example is during the sprint phase users will be able to drag and drop tickets to different areas of the sprint board.
