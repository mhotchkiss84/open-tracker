# Open Tracker
This is my server side capstone for my Full Stack .NET cohort. 

# Overview
This application is being made to allow users to be able to have an all in one project management solution instead of relying on multiple third party solutions, or having to pay for a solution. This application is intended to replace the current solutions by providing an open source platform that can be customized based on the users needs. This application solves the need to have to use multiple applications by combining their functionality into a single application.

Currently this application is being developed with C#, .Net, Identity framework, and Entity framework. I have plans later down the line to switch over to React for the front end and use Django for the backend. However due to having a 2 week time constraint for MVP on this project I ended up going with Entity framework. 

# Capstone MVP (minimum viable product with a 2 week deadline)
- User can create an account and login
- Once the user is logged in they will be able to create a new project
- Project Managers can assign other users to projects
- Project Managers can remove members of a project
- Users assigned to a project will be able to create issues
- Project Managers will be able to assign another user or self to the bug/issue tickets
- The ticket will be removed from the issue section of the project view
- Assigned members or project managers can edit an issue

# Stretch goals / future plans
- Project users can comment on an issue
- When a user completes the ticket or fixes the issue they can mark it as complete.
- Once a ticket has been marked as complete the user in charge of the project can review and confirm that the issue is fixed. 
- Users can view resolved tickets
- Users can chat in real time with project members
- Private messaging
- Issue tickets can be linked/related to current or previous tickets
- Notifications  of when a user is assigned an issue or receives a message.
- A live chat system for projects
- Add project planning to the site i.e. ERD support, Google Docs support, mockups, etc. 
- Add sprint system
